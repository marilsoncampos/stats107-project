  Ten years ago, Warren Buffett made a famous bet: the ultimate passive investment, the Vanguard S&P 500 Index Fund Admiral (VFIAX), vs. a basket of funds determined by a team of hedge fund experts. Whoever had a lower return after ten years would donate $1 million to the charity of choice of the winner. After eight years, it looks increasingly likely that Buffett will win the bet.

## Can a basket of funds beat the market in long term?

Our project aims to create a Mutual Fund selector for semi-passive investor. 
A typical Vanguard customer may have to choose from over one hundred mutual funds without any guidance. 
We will create a portfolio to maximize returns over the long term using several common, non-esoteric investment
strategies, such as maximizing the Sharpe Ratio.
In order to make this more realistic, we will take into account fees and transaction costs.
Since this is aimed at a typical Vanguard retail customer, no shorting will be allowed. 

We will simulate whether rebalancing on a bi-monthly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis is the best strategy. 

We will not account for taxes on the assumption that the funds are in a tax deferred account such as 401(k) or
IRA. For this reason, we will not evaluate ETFs which are at a disadvantage in a tax deferred account.

The portfolio will start with $100,000, which is the current average 401(k) balance 
(\href{http://time.com/money/4357248/retirement-401k-vanguard-balance/}{source}).

The overall time period will be evaluated on a twenty year history, or the maximum history of the security, whichever is shorter. 
The starting point for the basket of funds will be a common
default used by many organizations: a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund, such as VTHRX, the 2030 Retirement Fund.
The baseline or benchmark will be investing the same amount in VFIAX and leaving it there for the
duration.

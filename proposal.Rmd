  Ten years ago, Warren Buffett made a famous : the ultimate passive investment, the Vanguard S&P 500 Index Fund Admiral (VFIAX), vs. a basket of funds determined by a team of hedge fund experts. Whoever had a lower return after ten years would donate $1 million to the charity of choice of the winner. After eight years, it looks increasingly likely that Buffett will win the bet.

## Can anyone beat the market in long term?

Our project aims to create a Mutual Fund / ETF selector for semi-passive investor. 
A typical Vanguard customer may have over two hundred mutual fund and ETF choices. 
We will create a portfolio to maximize returns over the long term using several common, non-esoteric investment
strategies, such as maximizing the Sharpe Ratio.
In order to make this more realistic, we will take into account fees and transaction costs.
Since this is aimed at a typical Vanguard retail customer, no shorting will be allowed. 

We will simulate whether rebalancing on a bi-monthly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis is the best strategy. 

The overall time period will be evaluated on a twenty year history, or the maximum history of the security, whichever is shorter.  The baseline or benchmark will be investing the same amount in VFIAX and leaving it there for the
duration.

We will not account for taxes on the assumption that the funds are in a tax deferred account such as 401k or
IRA.

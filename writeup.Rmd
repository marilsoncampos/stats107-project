abstract: |
  Ten years ago, Warren Buffett made a famous : the ultimate passive investment, the Vanguard S&P 500 Index Fund Admiral (VFIAX), vs. a basket of funds determined by a team of hedge fund experts. Whoever had a lower return after ten years would donate $1 million to the charity of choice of the winner. After eight years, it looks increasingly likely that Buffett will win the bet.
